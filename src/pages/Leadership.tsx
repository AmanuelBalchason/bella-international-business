            Our amazing journey started at a family-run historic coffee farm, nestled close to the place where 
            the legendary Khaldi first discovered coffee beans. This inspired the birth of Bella International Business, 
            and throughout our journey, we've created job opportunities for over 400 permanent and contract employees 
            as we continue to expand our horizons across the Horn of Africa.
