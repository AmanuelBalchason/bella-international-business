## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS FOR EMAIL DELIVERY:

### 1. Configure Resend API Key (REQUIRED)
If not already done:
- Go to [Resend API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- Create a new API key
- Add it to Supabase secrets as `RESEND_API_KEY`

### 2. Verify Domain in Resend (CRITICAL)
**This is likely why emails aren't being delivered:**
- Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
- Add and verify `bellainternational.app` domain
- **Without domain verification, emails will not be sent**

### 3. Test Email Delivery
1. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Email Diagnostics
